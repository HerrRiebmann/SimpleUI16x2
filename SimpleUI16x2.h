/**
 * This library provides a simple User Interface for Input and Output with an 
 * 16x2 Character Display and some Buttons. Some examples:
 * 
 * ============================== A simple menu with some entries. You can navigate through
 * | Titel                      | it using the Up and Down Keys. For selecting an entry use
 * | > Entry                    | Right or Select Key. To abort, if you allow it, use the Left Key. 
 * ============================== The return will be 0-(N-1) for the entry or -1 for abort.
 *
 * ============================== A nice input in percents. Input in 1% steps using the up/down keys and 10%
 * | Titel                      | using the left/right keys. You ca also set a function, which will be called
 * | [==========       ]  63%   | every time something changes (for example you want to adjust the volume 
 * ============================== with an sound example every time the volume is changed).
 *
 * ============================== Fast Number Input with the arrow keys. With Up/Down you can add/substract
 * | 2356                       | the Summand 10^N (1,10,100,...), which you can using Right/Left.
 * |                <+/-100>    | With Select you submit the number.
 * ==============================
 *
 * ============================== Simple String Input like those on Game Consoles. With only arrow-keys
 * | stringinput_               | you can't get a less worse option. The writing position blinks.
 * |                            |
 * ==============================
 * 
 * There are also some functions for Buttons. You have to set(constructor) the function for the buttons 
 * yourself, since I don't know how to read your buttons. You will find an example for that.
 * Maybe there are still some bugs, but the library is short and easy. You will have no problems fixing
 * them by yourself.
 *
 * It only works with LiquidCrystal-Library-Displays, but you should have no problem to wrap any other
 * display-library or change this library.
